# Innerbloom – Concept Brief (Product, not tech)

> **One‑liner**  
A life‑gamification coach that turns goals into daily quests, celebrates progress with Duolingo‑style feedback, and builds habits through XP, streaks, and rewards.

---

## 1) Problem & Insight
- People know *what they want*, but not *what to do today*.
- Motivation is spiky; consistency dies after week 2.
- Tools track, **they don’t coach**: no small, timely wins → drop‑off.

**Innerbloom reframes self‑improvement as a game loop**: clear actions, instant feedback, visible progress.

---

## 2) Core Model (Pillar → Trait → Stat → Task)
- **Pillars**: Body · Mind · Soul.  
- **Traits** (per pillar): e.g., Energy, Focus, Calm.  
- **Stats**: each trait has a measurable stat.  
- **Tasks**: simple daily actions linked to a stat, each with **Difficulty** and **XP**.

**User sees only the next 3–6 tasks**, tailored to their Game Mode and rhythm.

---

## 3) Game Modes (calibrate volume & difficulty)
- **Low Mode**: minimal activation, reduce friction, tiny wins.  
- **Chill Mode**: steady baseline, balance across pillars.  
- **Flow Mode**: goal‑oriented progression with habit scaffolding.  
- **Evolve Mode**: stretch goals, progressive overload, missions.

Modes define task volume, XP pacing, and thresholds for rewards.

---

## 4) The Loops
### Daily Loop (1–3 minutes)
1) See today’s quests (3–6 tasks).  
2) Check off completed tasks → **earn XP**, keep **streaks**.  
3) **Pop‑ups dopamine**: micro‑celebrations for each milestone.

### Weekly Loop
- **Missions**: “Do task X ≥ N times/week for Y consecutive weeks.”  
- **Tiers & Rewards**: unlockables based on consistency; weekly summary recommends next focus.

---

## 5) Duolingo‑style Feedback Layer
- **Micro‑celebrations**: confetti, badges, streak meters, level‑ups, mission clears.
- **Contextual messages**: low mood → display cumulative progress + one mini‑task “lifeline”.
- **Adaptive cadence**: A/B timing, copy, and pop‑up types to maximize adherence.
- **Economy of Achievements**: collectible badges per pillar/trait, with tiered goals and combo bonuses.

Goal: convert **action → reward → momentum** into a tight, satisfying loop.

---

## 6) Personalization (lightweight, scalable)
- **Onboarding form** captures goal, context, preferences, and rhythm.  
- Generates a **personal BBDD** (Pillar > Trait > Stat > Task > Difficulty).  
- **Auto‑balance**: if one pillar lags, the system reweights tasks to restore balance.  
- **Emotion Check‑in** (daily) informs load and messaging.

---

## 7) Rewards & Missions (Business Logic)
- **XP**: per task, scaled by Difficulty and Mode.  
- **Levels**: visible progress bar; XP needed scales sensibly.  
- **Streaks**: daily & weekly; protect with “streak freeze” items (future).  
- **Missions**: weekly consistency objectives (C1S→C4S).  
- **Tiers**: unlockables gated by current/longest streaks; potential **bonus multipliers** on completion.

---

## 8) First‑Week Experience (User Journey)
Day 0: Intro form → select Mode → auto‑generated quest set.  
Day 1–3: 3–6 tiny tasks/day, instant celebrations, first streak built.  
Day 4–5: first **badge**; highlight balance across Body–Mind–Soul.  
Day 6–7: **weekly mission** recap → suggest next focus; tease next reward.

---

## 9) North‑star & KPIs
- **North‑star**: Weekly Consistency Rate (users completing ≥ X tasks/week).  
- Core KPIs: DAU/WAU, 7‑day onboarding completion, weekly mission completion rate, streak length (current & longest), mood adherence, feature engagement with pop‑ups.

---

## 10) Monetization (directional)
- **Premium Missions & Tiers** (advanced goals, XP multipliers).  
- **Cosmetics** (badge styles, themes).  
- **Pro coaching packs** (curated quests for specific goals).  
- **Teams/Challenges** (social—later).

---

## 11) Product Principles
- **Clarity first**: always answer “¿qué hago hoy?”.  
- **Small wins** > big plans: momentum over perfection.  
- **Balance**: no pillar left behind.  
- **Celebrate often**: feedback that feels earned and energizing.  
- **Privacy & kindness**: non‑judgmental, supportive tone.

---

## 12) Glossary
- **Pillar**: Body, Mind, Soul.  
- **Trait**: quality within a pillar (e.g., Focus).  
- **Stat**: measurable variable for a trait.  
- **Task**: atomic action tied to a stat; has Difficulty & XP.  
- **Mode**: user’s pace/intensity (Low/Chill/Flow/Evolve).  
- **Mission**: weekly constraint (X per week for Y weeks).  
- **Tier**: reward band unlocked by streaks/consistency.  
- **Pop‑ups dopamine**: instant, Duolingo‑style feedback moments.

---

## 13) Out of Scope (for MVP)
- Social graphs, marketplaces, long‑form content.  
- Heavy AI coaching; start with rule‑based personalization.

---

## 14) MVP Snapshot
- Onboarding → personal quest list (3–6/day).  
- Check‑off flow with XP, level, streaks.  
- Weekly missions & a basic rewards tier.  
- Pop‑ups dopamine for all key events.  
- Weekly recap + next‑focus suggestion.

---

**Voice & Tone**: clear, supportive, playful—never preachy.  
**Outcome**: habits formed, goals achieved, progress users *want* to sustain.
